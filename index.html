<td><h3><u>Buffer underflow exploits.</u> </h3> <p>These are things such as heart bleed. These work by telling the machine that 64kb of data was sent to them; they then reply with the 64kb of data which was acctaully 5b or so. This would make the machine send you 64kb of data saved on the RAM. This could include passwords or other things.</p></td>
<td><h3><u>SQL Injection</u> </h3><p> SQL injection is used to change or get infomation from an SQL database.This is done by doing this: <b>";php code</b> nowadays it is mainly patched however it's not patched everywhere...</p></td>
<td><h3><u>Man in The Middle</u></h3><p> This is fairly straight forward.. It involves ARP Spoofing (I'll add a box for that soon) and deodging encryptions to get passwords from people on a local network. Basicly it turns your computer into the router so you can intercept and change network traffic. Once again it is very simialr to ARP Spoofing.</p></td>
<td><h3><u>ARP Spoofing</u></h3><p> ...WORK IN PROGRESS...</p></td>
